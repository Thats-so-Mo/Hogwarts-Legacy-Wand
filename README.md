# Hogwarts-Legacy-Wand
## Use the Kano Wand for Hogwarts Legacy (PC Only)
The basic idea behind this project is to convert the gestures/movements of the wand into keyboard button presses.
This uses GammaGames' Kano_wand module/code (https://github.com/GammaGames/kano_wand) and I have a copy of their code/module included within my respiority as a way to make it easier for people. He has two respositories dedicated to the kano wand;https://github.com/GammaGames/kano_wand and https://github.com/GammaGames/kano-wand-demos (PLEASE CHECK THEM OUT)
